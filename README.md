# ZenToolBoxx (ZenTBx) ðŸ˜º - 
ZEN: Tool box to handle, search and quickly manipulate files in our Windows OS.

- All-Inclusive package with TOP software for Windows OS to better find, manipulate and control your files (documents, audios, videos, etc) without the need to pay for external tools or rely on inneficient workarounds or no functionalities bundled in Ms Windows (for example Windows Search has very slow response, is very heavy for the system and the matching/finding system is not accurate https://computerinfobits.com/why-is-windows-10-search-so-bad/)

# Progress Emoji System (PES) ðŸ™€

As you have read in the WHY_THIS_PROJECT link, ZenTBx is a way to bring to life a software using basic SW concepts and time of the ZTBxers who PRIMARLY wants to validate their academical/theoretical knowledge in a real open source project.

Because of the nature of the project, it is constructed in a way a bit different than the traditional open source since most of the parts will be mocked (interfaces/contracts) and later they will be actually implemented (real implementation).

For this a simple system of emoji, will indicate the reality/valid of each section to allow our ZTBxers identify what status/part are they identifying:

ðŸ™€ - Section is not done (not even close), its just a dream/draft to give the ZTBxer the idea of what we suggest/expect in the section
ðŸ˜º - Section is done but not validated/reviewed by the ZTBx community, in this case the component is already true/exist but is in early stage
ðŸ˜» - Section is completed (done + validated/reviewed by ZTBx community), fully functional info/component
ðŸ˜¿ - Section has no draft, also not description of how to achieve the component
ðŸ˜¡ - Section has many problems / warning a special attention here is needed and possible a total new approche/rewrite

As you have read in the WHY_THIS_PROJECT link, ZenTBx is a way to bring to life a software using basic concepts of Software Development and Software project management based on the available/free/spare time of a communitiy of ZTBexers who wants to validate their academical/theoretical knowledge in a real open source project.

The project will be constructed in a way a bit different than the traditional open source  since most of the parts will be mocked (interfaces/contracts) and later they will be actually implemented (real implementation).
